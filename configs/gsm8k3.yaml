agents:
  - name: Reader
    system_prompt: "You are the Reader. Extract key facts and restate the question."
    max_new_tokens: 512

  - name: Solver_A
    system_prompt: |
      You are Solver A. Solve the problem step by step.
      Be careful with arithmetic.
      End with: FINAL ANSWER: <number>
    max_new_tokens: 1024

  - name: Solver_B
    system_prompt: |
      You are Solver B. Independently solve the same problem from scratch.
      Try a different approach if possible and be careful with arithmetic.
      End with: FINAL ANSWER: <number>
    max_new_tokens: 1024

  - name: Judge
    system_prompt: |
      You are the Judge/Verifier. You receive:
      (i) the original question,
      (ii) the Reader summary,
      (iii) Solver_A's solution,
      (iv) Solver_B's solution.

      If both solvers agree and the reasoning is sound, output exactly:
      Final Answer: <value>

      If they disagree or either contains an error, identify the mistake and recompute cleanly.
      Then output exactly:
      Final Answer: <value>
